# Code of Conduct

White Whale has an open, friendly, diverse and welcoming community. We accept and respect everybody equally, but we don't 
tolerate harassing, trolling or spamming. We are here to build, not to engage in toxic behavior.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

All White Whale contributors are expected to be respectful towards other members of the team and the community. We expect 
you to act professionally, respect other people's opinions and act on the best interest of the protocol.


## Conflict resolution

When the opinions of multiple contributors or community members differ, the conflict should be resolved by communication. 
Use the appropriate channels to discuss what matters to you, show empathy towards other community members by listening 
to and respecting other's point of view. Set up a gov proposal and let the community vote on the matter.

Remember to focus on what is best for the protocol.


# TLDR

Be kind.
